Note, this is predominately a mobile-only app. While desktop is just as functional, the UI design is intended to make it as easy and fast as possible to use on a mobile device. 

## Usage:
- Enter your group's starting location.
- Filter out any undesirable options. The more options you delete the further away the restaurants become.
- Click the green check to create a group. Currently the app gives you the three closest restaurants.
- Share the URL! Anyone who joins can vote on where to eat! You can change your vote as your hunger dictates.

## Description:
This started as personal project during my time at Turing School. The problem it helps solve is one that I've often encountered with my classmates at around lunch time. We can't decide where to eat. And nobody is making suggestions.

Lunch-r solves this by offering three lunch options that are near you. Just share the link with the group. Everyone votes, and the consensus will rise to the top.
